## Quick start

Manage the runtime with Homebrew and a user-local SbarLua install, then sync and build the config:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binbinsh/sketchybar-config/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

The bootstrap script verifies the required commands, SbarLua install, and Nerd Font families, then syncs the repo, rebuilds native helpers, and reloads SketchyBar when it is already running.
Detailed runtime notes: `docs/runtime.md`.
Window management is not installed by this repo. Use [binbinsh/rectangle](https://github.com/binbinsh/rectangle) separately and apply the recommended settings in `docs/rectangle.md`.
